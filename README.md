# Assignment 2

This is a template repository for the laboratory assignment 2.

Complete the tasks in `tasks.ipynb` file and submit a PR to the original repository. Push outputs of each python cell to the origin (do not clear them after execution, so that I could take a look). Please, describe as much information as possible in your PR, and submit a link to that PR in the moodle system (you can save the link in `.txt` file and submit it there, for example).

In each task replace the comments inside method with your own code solutions, and run the cell. You can also try these methods on different outputs than the ones given.

Any additional questions can be submitted via [email](mailto:va.melnyk@chnu.edu.ua), [telegram](https://t.me/+rsgY7YhR27UwNDQy) or in [github issues](https://github.com/chnu-sci-tech/lab-2/issues). Good luck!
